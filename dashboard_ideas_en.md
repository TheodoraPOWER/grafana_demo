# Grafana Dashboard Ideas for Cybersecurity Analysis

Here is a series of ideas for Grafana dashboards using the flattened JSON data source. Each dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights into the organization's cybersecurity posture.

---

## 1. Cybersecurity Posture Overview

*   **Title:** Cybersecurity Posture Overview
*   **Description:** A high-level dashboard that displays the overall score for each cybersecurity function (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) and their categories. It provides a quick view of strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Impact:** Allows cybersecurity leaders and managers to quickly understand the overall security status and focus attention on the highest-risk areas.
*   **How to Read It:**
    *   **Function Score Gauges:** A gauge for each of the 5 functions, showing the score from 0 to 100. The gauge color can change based on the score (red for low, yellow for medium, green for high).
    *   **Category Score Bar Chart:** A bar chart showing the score for each category, grouped by function. This allows for easy comparison between categories.
    *   **Scores Table:** A table summarizing the function and category scores, with the ability to sort by score to identify the lowest-performing areas.

## 2. Maturity Analysis by Domain

*   **Title:** Maturity Analysis by Domain
*   **Description:** This dashboard visualizes the maturity levels (policy, process, implementation, measured, managed) across the different categories and subcategories.
*   **Impact:** Helps identify whether weaknesses lie in policy definition, process execution, or control implementation, enabling more targeted improvement actions.
*   **How to Read It:**
    *   **Maturity Radar Chart:** A radar chart for each category, showing the 5 maturity levels on the axes. This provides a visual way to see the balance (or imbalance) in maturity.
    *   **Maturity Heatmap:** A heatmap with subcategories on the Y-axis and maturity levels on the X-axis. The color of each cell represents the score, making it easy to identify patterns and problem areas.
    *   **Filters:** Filters by function and category to drill down into specific areas.

## 3. Effort vs. Score Analysis (Quick Wins)

*   **Title:** Effort vs. Score Analysis (Quick Wins)
*   **Description:** A dashboard that correlates the `estimated_level_of_effort_in_hours` with the `subcategory_score` to identify the subcategories that offer the greatest improvement for the least effort.
*   **Impact:** Allows cybersecurity teams to prioritize tasks more effectively, focusing on "quick wins" that can significantly improve the security posture with a reasonable time investment.
*   **How to Read It:**
    *   **Scatter Plot:** A scatter plot with the estimated effort on the X-axis and the subcategory score on the Y-axis. Points in the lower-left quadrant represent "quick wins" (low effort, low current score, so there is room for improvement).
    *   **Prioritization Table:** A table listing the subcategories, their score, the estimated effort, and a calculated "priority index" (e.g., `score / effort`). This can be sorted by the index to see the top priorities.

## 4. Risk Register View

*   **Title:** Risk Register View
*   **Description:** This dashboard focuses on the subcategories that have entries in the `risk_register`, providing a centralized view of identified risks.
*   **Impact:** Facilitates the tracking and management of known risks, ensuring they receive appropriate attention.
*   **How to Read It:**
    *   **Risks Table:** A table showing the function, category, subcategory, and the content of the `risk_register` field for all subcategories where this field is not null.
    *   **Filters:** Filters by function and category to narrow down the list of risks.
    *   **Key Indicators:** Stat cards showing the total number of registered risks and the number of risks per function.

---

## 5. Compliance and Artifacts Status

*   **Title:** Compliance and Artifacts Status
*   **Description:** A dashboard to track the status of compliance documentation and artifacts. It shows which subcategories have the necessary evidence (`artifacts_placed_in_folder` = 'Y') and which do not.
*   **Impact:** Helps audit and compliance teams to quickly identify documentation gaps and prepare for audits.
*   **How to Read It:**
    *   **Pie Chart:** A pie chart showing the percentage of subcategories with and without artifacts.
    *   **Artifact Gaps Table:** A table listing all subcategories where `artifacts_placed_in_folder` is 'N' or null. The table should include the function, category, and subcategory for easy identification.
    *   **Filters:** Filters by function and category to analyze the status of artifacts in specific areas.

## 6. Detailed Subcategory Explorer

*   **Title:** Detailed Subcategory Explorer
*   **Description:** A table-based dashboard that allows security analysts to explore all the details of each subcategory in a tabular format, with powerful filtering and search capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Provides a "deep dive" tool for detailed investigations, root cause analysis, and remediation planning.
*   **How to Read It:**
    *   **Main Table:** A large table with all the columns from the flattened JSON.
    *   **Advanced Filters:** Filters for each column (function, category, maturity, etc.).
    *   **Free-Text Search:** A search bar to find keywords in fields like `assessment_results` and `assessment_reccommendations`.
